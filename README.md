# Roulette

> Roulette is a casino game named after the French word meaning little wheel. In the game, players may choose to place bets on either a single number, various groupings of numbers, the colors red or black, whether the number is odd or even, or if the numbers are high (19–36) or low (1–18)

## API
- /roulette/v1/placeBet
- /actuator/health - This can be used to check application health. This is provided by SpringBoot out of the box as we have added 'spring-boot-starter-actuator' dependency

## Prerequisites
- Java8
- Maven 3.X
- Editor of your choice (Intellij, Eclipse, etc)
- Internet connectivity to download dependency artifacts from maven repo
- 

## Getting Started
- Clone this project on your system and import using maven. If this is the first time you are importing project, it will take a while to download all dependenies from maven repo
- Once project has been imported you can simply run RouletteApplication.java and start accessing end points
- Alternatively you can run maven command (mvn clean install) to generate artifact (jar) and execute 
java -jar target/roulette-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar (update version as required)
  

## Example
- Sample json requests are available under /src/main/resources/postman. You would need a postman plugin/application. You can simply use import postman collection and get started. 
- Sample jmx file is also available under /src/main/resources/postman. This can be used as a baseline and further extended to perform load test using Jmeter


## TODO
- Implement additional bet validation
- Add more unit tests
- Update logging configuration to redirect logs to files
- Implement logging using AOP
- Secure endpoint
- Implement custom annotation to identify Bet types and use annotations to register bet types as JsonSubTypes of Bet
- Implement Swagger
- Externalize values of bean properties wherever required
- Configure maven release plugin
- Check system performance using Jconsole/Jprofiler
